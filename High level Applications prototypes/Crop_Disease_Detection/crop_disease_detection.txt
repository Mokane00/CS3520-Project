Crop Disease Detection
Brief Notes on Rationale
This prototype acts like a simple version of an AI tool that spots crop diseases by processing a low-resolution image, similar to how a CNN (convolutional neural network) would work. It does quick matrix calculations to mimic identifying pests or diseases, keeping memory use low so it can run offline on cheap phones. Itâ€™s designed to help tackle the 20-40% crop losses in Lesotho by being fast and power-efficient for rural farmers.
