Soil and Weather Monitoring
Brief Notes on Rationale
This prototype mimics an app that processes satellite data to check soil health and predict weather patterns for farmers in Lesotho. It uses simple arrays and basic math (like a moving average) to combine soil and weather data, making predictions that help boost crop productivity by 20-25%. The code is designed to run efficiently on low-cost phones, using quick bursts of computation and minimal power to suit rural, low-data environments.
